            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Vulnerability Assessment is the foundation of a strong cybersecurity strategy. 
                Unlike penetration testing, which simulates real-world attacks, vulnerability 
                assessments focus on systematically identifying, classifying, and prioritizing 
                security weaknesses in your systems before they can be exploited. This service 
                provides a clear and accurate picture of your attack surface and helps guide 
                your risk mitigation efforts.
            </p>

            <h3>What I Offer</h3>
            
            <p>
                I conduct thorough assessments using both automated tools and manual 
                techniques, tailored to your environment. My services include:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Asset Discovery & Enumeration</strong><br>
                <strong>Network & Infrastructure Scanning</strong><br>
                <strong>Web Application Vulnerability Scanning</strong><br>
                <strong>Risk Prioritization & Remediation Planning</strong><br>
                <strong>Detailed Reporting with Severity Ratings</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The process concludes with a risk-based analysis that provides insights into 
                the impact and likelihood of each vulnerability â€” along with a strategic plan 
                to remediate or mitigate them.
            </p>
                <p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>
            <p>
                Many breaches occur not due to sophisticated attacks, but because of unpatched 
                systems, misconfigurations, and overlooked flaws. Regular vulnerability 
                assessments help organizations stay ahead of threats, meet compliance 
                requirements, and ensure business continuity. It's an essential practice for 
                maintaining a strong security baseline.
            </p>
            <h3>Tools and Methodologies</h3>
            <p>
                I follow <strong>OWASP Top 10</strong>, <strong>PTES</strong>, and 
                <strong>NIST SP 800-115</strong> standards, 
                using tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom Python/Bash scripts.

                Tools used include <strong>Nessus</strong>, <strong>OpenVAS</strong>, 
                <strong>Nmap</strong>, <strong>Nikto</strong>, and custom scripts for 
                enhanced scanning. I follow industry-recognized frameworks such as <strong>CVSS</strong>, 
                <strong>OWASP</strong>, and <strong>NIST Risk Management Framework.</strong>
