            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Incident Response is a critical service that ensures your organization is prepared to react quickly and effectively 
                when a security breach occurs. It’s not a question of “if” an incident will happen — but “when.” A well-coordinated 
                response can make the difference between a contained event and a catastrophic breach.
            </p>

            <h3>What I Offer</h3>
            <p>
                My Incident Response services are designed to detect, contain, and remediate cybersecurity incidents with minimal 
                disruption to your operations. Key offerings include:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>24/7 Response Support & Coordination</strong><br>
                <strong>Digital Forensics & Log Analysis</strong><br>
                <strong>Malware Identification & Root Cause Investigation</strong><br>
                <strong>Threat Containment & Remediation Guidance</strong><br>
                <strong>Post-Incident Reporting & Lessons Learned</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I work closely with your team to mitigate active threats, recover compromised systems, and help strengthen your 
                environment against future attacks.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>
            <p>
                When incidents aren’t handled quickly and properly, they can escalate into data breaches, legal liabilities, or 
                brand damage. Having an experienced specialist at your side during a crisis ensures evidence is preserved, damage 
                is minimized, and the path to recovery is swift and efficient.
            </p>

            <h3>Tools and Methodologies</h3>
            <p>
                I leverage industry-standard tools such as <strong>Wireshark</strong>, <strong>Volatility</strong>, 
                <strong>The Sleuth Kit</strong>, and <strong>Linux-native forensic utilities</strong> to investigate and triage 
                incidents. My approach aligns with <strong>NIST SP 800-61</strong>, <strong>SANS IR Framework</strong>, and 
                <strong>MITRE ATT&CK</strong> to ensure professionalism, consistency, and effectiveness in every response engagement.
